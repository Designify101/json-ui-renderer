# CSS Class Extraction Solution

## Problem
Your JSON UI Generator project uses Tailwind CSS classes dynamically in JSON configurations. During build, Tailwind's purge mechanism removes these CSS classes because it can't detect them in the JSON files, causing styling issues in production.

## Solution
Implemented an automated CSS class extraction system that:

1. **Scans all template files** before each build/dev run
2. **Extracts CSS classes** from JSON configurations 
3. **Generates a file** that Tailwind can scan during content discovery
4. **Ensures all dynamic classes** are included in both dev and production builds

## How It Works

### 1. Extraction Script (`scripts/extract-template-classes.js`)
- Scans all `.ts` and `.js` files in the `lib/` directory
- Uses regex patterns to find CSS classes in `className:` properties
- Generates `generated/template-classes.js` with all extracted classes
- Automatically excludes template variables (containing `{{` or `$`)

### 2. Build Integration (`package.json`)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "extract-css": "node scripts/extract-template-classes.js",
    "prebuild": "npm run extract-css",    // Runs before build
    "predev": "npm run extract-css",      // Runs before dev
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

### 3. Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`)
```typescript
content: [
  "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",      // Scan template files
  "./types/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",     // Scan type files
  "./generated/template-classes.js",      // Generated CSS classes
  "*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"
],
```

### 4. Generated Output (`generated/template-classes.js`)
```javascript
// Auto-generated file with all CSS classes from templates
export const templateClasses = [
  "bg-gray-900",
  "text-white", 
  "rounded-3xl",
  "p-6",
  // ... 318+ classes extracted from your templates
];
```

## Current Status
‚úÖ **318 unique CSS classes** extracted from templates  
‚úÖ **Automatic extraction** before build and dev  
‚úÖ **Works in both development and production**  
‚úÖ **No manual maintenance required**  

## Benefits

### üöÄ Automated
- No manual safelist maintenance
- Runs automatically with every build/dev
- Adapts as you add new templates

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliable  
- Ensures all template CSS classes are included
- Works in both development and production
- Prevents styling issues from missing classes

### üîß Maintainable
- Generated file is ignored in git (`.gitignore`)
- Self-documenting with class counts and timestamps
- Easy to debug - can run `npm run extract-css` manually

### üìà Scalable
- Handles any number of templates
- Supports all CSS class formats
- Future-proof as your project grows

## Usage

### Normal Development
```bash
npm run dev    # CSS extraction runs automatically
npm run build  # CSS extraction runs automatically  
```

### Manual Extraction (if needed)
```bash
npm run extract-css  # Run extraction manually
```

### Adding New Templates
Just add your new template files to the `lib/` directory with CSS classes in this format:
```typescript
props: {
  className: "bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg"
}
```

The extraction script will automatically find and include these classes in the next build.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `scripts/extract-template-classes.js` - Extraction script
- `generated/template-classes.js` - Generated CSS classes (auto-created)
- `CSS-EXTRACTION-SOLUTION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files  
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Added content paths for template scanning
- `package.json` - Added extraction scripts and prebuild/predev hooks
- `.gitignore` - Added `/generated/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### If classes are missing:
1. Run `npm run extract-css` to see what's being extracted
2. Check that your CSS classes are in `className: "..."` format
3. Verify template files are in the `lib/` directory

### If extraction fails:
1. Check that Node.js can access the `lib/` directory
2. Verify template files have valid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax
3. Look for errors in the extraction script output

This solution completely eliminates the CSS purging issue while maintaining optimal build performance and requiring zero manual maintenance! üéâ
